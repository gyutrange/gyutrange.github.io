## About Me
I am a student and engineer interested in vulnerability analysis and information security consulting.  
I am passionate about discovering new vulnerabilities and preventing their exploitation.  

Through these activities, I am dedicated to developing new security policies. As an engineer committed to finding vulnerabilities and defending against attacks, I have a keen interest in various attack and defense techniques, secure coding, forensics, and AI-driven exploit automation.  
My goal is to become a leader in cybersecurity in Korea, creating and leading robust security policies.
